PYTHON ASSIGNMENT

# Task 1: Calculate Area with Conditions
Write a Python function calculate_area that takes two parameters: length and width. It
should calculate and return the area of a rectangle. However, add a condition: if the length
is equal to the width, return "This is a square!" instead of the area. Then, write a program to
input values for length and width from the user and call the calculate_area function to
display either the area or the message.
# Task 3: MySQL Database Operations with Python 
Problem Statement:
Your task is to write a Python program that accomplishes the following:
First create a database , table and add these column ‘student_id’, ‘first_name’, ‘last_name’,
‘age’, ‘grade’.
Connects to your MySQL database with python.
Inserts a new student record into the "students" table with the following details:
First Name: "Alice"
Last Name: "Smith"
Age: 18
Grade: 95.5
Updates the grade of the student with the first name "Alice" to 97.0.
Deletes the student with the last name "Smith."
Fetches and displays all student records from the "students" table.

# Task 2: Generate Fibonacci Series
Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of
terms, n. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number in the
sequence is the sum of the two preceding numbers (e.g., 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...). Prompt the
user to enter the number of terms (n) they want in the sequence and then display the
Fibonacci sequence up to that number of terms.
